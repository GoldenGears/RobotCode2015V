A quick note about the new version control system.

Version control has been revamped to make it easier to switch between versions.
Now, there will be three directories:
src/
	Code to be deployed. This is what Eclipse will see and what you can edit.
SandBox/
	Un-committed code. When a version is completed, but not fully tested, it goes here until it is ready to be committed. These can and will be overwritten a lot.
Versions/
	Code to be committed. When a version is finished, it is to be placed here and then pushed to the repository. Once a version has been committed, it should NOT be edited.
	
Each commit will ONLY store a version number. All notes about which files were changed go in ChangeLog.txt. All specific changes that were made go where they used to at the top of the files.

Example:

src/
	Robot.cpp
		// Tyler Robbins - 1-31-15 - Made a file!
Sandbox/
	src.v0/
		Robot.cpp
			// Tyler Robbins - 1-31-15 - Made a file!
Versions/
	.git/
	src.v0/
		Robot.cpp
			// Tyler Robbins - 1-31-15 - Made a file!
